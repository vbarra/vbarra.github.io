    "text": "Characterization of volcanic emissions through thermal vision\n\nIn April 2010, the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland) threw volcanic ash several kilometres up into the atmosphere, an event which led to air travel disruption across northwest Europe for six days and which included the closure of airspace over many parts of Europe. This crisis spotlighted the necessity to parameterise and simulate plume dynamics through emission, dispersion and fall out as to better model, track and forecast cloud motions and locations. This eruption was classified as a Strombolian to Sub-Plinian eruption type. Numerous volcanoes from the five continents produce strombolian eruptions, which are a relatively mild form of explosive volcanic activity. Strombolian eruptions are small explosive events, 100s to 1000s of meter in height which occur more frequently than Vulcanian. They are also notable for the brilliant incandescent parabolic arcs traced by their molten ejecta. Emission of bombs, blocks, lapilli, and minor coarse ash is common during normal explosive activity. Lava flows and ash-rich eruptions plus paroxysms that send ash clouds to several kilometers are also frequent events as well.\nOn Stromboli, Strombolian activity has been observed and studied over several centuries. Over this period, the constant evolution of technology and the proliferation of monitoring equipment has improved our understanding of conduit dynamics and explosive behavior. Active volcanoes emit heat through lava flows, domes, lakes, degassing and erupting vents. Remote measurements of heat emission from such active features provide insights into the physical processes governing the associated volcanic activity. However, analyses and modelling as well as post processing of thermal data are still not fully automated, and quantitative parameters to feed to the modelers and responders in near-real time remain difficult to extract and provide.\nSince 2001, thermal camera video has been increasingly used to track, parametrize and understand dynamic volcanic events, such that the use of such a capability is beginning to eclipse that of the satellite-based perspective. However, the complexity and size of these data sets are compounding the current problem of ever-accelerating data dates so as to require development new and different methodologies. For ongoing volcanic events, parameters, such as mass flux, ascent (or spreading) velocity and plume or lava expansion spreading rate, are key for understanding the dynamics of the explosive and effusive eruptions and the source mechanisms that drive them.\nIn this project, we concentrate on the different components of strombolian eruptions at the full range of remote sensing spatial scales. These range from millimeters (for individual particles in single thermal camera pixels) to kilometers (for the entire features imaged with the satellite field of view). We aim to characterise volcanic emissions through thermal vision.\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nM Bombrun, D Jessop, A Harris, V Barra.

An interesting feature for the application of TMC is to use auxiliary processes which model the non-stationarity. The primary purpose of our work was to present a novel methodology based on TMC for modeling a non-stationary Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. In order to assess the performance of the proposed model, experiments were carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI time series of the northwestern region of Tunisia. The developed model was also compared to classical HMM and Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). TMC was the highest among three methods, with an overall classification accuracy of 92.8% and a kappa coefficient of 0.885.\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nA Ferchichi, A Ben Abbes, V Barra, I.R Farah.

    "text": "Detection of changes in urban areas\n\nRemotely sensed data are a significant source for monitoring and updating databases for land use/cover. Nowadays, changes detection of urban area has been a subject of intensive researches. Timely and accurate data on spatio-temporal changes of urban areas are therefore required. The data extracted from multi- temporal satellite images are usually non-stationary. In fact, the changes evolve in time and space. We proposed a methodology for changes detection in urban area by combining a non-stationary decomposition method and stochastic modeling. We consider as input of our methodology a sequence of satellite images at different periods. Firstly, a radiometric, atmospheric and geometric preprocessing of multi-temporal satellite images is applied.The systematic study of global urban expansion in our methodology can be approached in two ways: The first considers the urban area as one same object as opposed to non-urban areas (e.g. vegetation, bare soil and water). The objective is to extract the urban mask. The second one aims to obtain a more knowledge of urban area, distinguishing different types of tissue within the urban area. In order to validate our approach, we used a database of Tres Cantos-Madrid in Spain, which is derived from Landsat for a period (from January 2004 to July 2013) by collecting two frames per year at a spatial resolution of 25 meters. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our method.\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nA Ben Abbess, H Essid, I Riadh Farah, V Barra.

    "text": "Image to image translation\n\nDeep generative models have recently become popular in heliophysics for their capacity to fill in gaps in solar observational datasets, thereby helping mitigating the data scarcity issue faced in space weather forecasting.\nMagnetograms are used as boundary condition of physical models to reconstruct the global solar magnetic field, but we have a direct access to magnetogram from a limited number of sources, and up now, only one vantage point. EUV images on the other hand offers vantage points from the far side of the Sun thanks to the STEREO mission. It is thus of interest to generate magnetogram out of EUV images, and to assess the errors made when using the generated models into PFSS models, and later on, models of the solar wind such as EUHFORIA.\nIn a first work, we use paired and unpaired image-to-image translation models to generate magnetograms from 171, 193 and 304 EUV images. The models also allows to reverse the process in order to generate EUV images from HMI. We evaluate the confidence these generated images using a test set, and we shed lights on some potential improvements and generalization processes.\n\n\n\nIn another work,we studied a particular type of deep generative models, called conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN), that has been used since a few years in the context of image-to-image (I2I) translation on solar observations. These algorithms have however hyperparameters whose values might influence the quality of the synthetic image.\nWe use magnetograms produced by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and EUV images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for the problem of generating Artificial Intelligence (AI) synthetic magnetograms from multiple SDO/AIA channels using cGAN, and more precisely the Pix2PixCC algorithm. We perform a systematic study of the most important hyperparameters to investigate which hyperparameter might generate magnetograms of highest quality with respect to the Structural Similarity Index. We propose a structured way to perform training with various hyperparameter values, and provide diagnostic and visualization tools of the generated versus targeted image. Our results shows that when using a larger number of filters in the convolution blocks of the cGAN, the fine details in the generated magnetogram are better reconstructed. Adding several input channels besides the 304 channel does not improve the quality of generated magnetogram, but the hyperparameters controlling the relative importance of the different loss functions in the optimization process have an influence on the quality of the results.\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nM Dannehl, V Delouille, V Barra, An experimental study on EUV-to-magnetogram image translation using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, Earth and Space Science (2023, submitted)\nV Barra, V Delouille.

We proposed two ways of performing such a study :\n\na multi-channel unsupervised spatially-constrained fuzzy clustering algorithm that automatically segments EUV solar images into Coronal Holes, Quiet Sun and Active Regions. Fuzzy logic allows to manage the various noises present in the images and the imprecision in the deﬁnition of the above regions. The process is fast and automatic. It is applied to SoHO-EIT images taken from January 1997 till May 2005, i.e. along almost a full solar cycle. Results in terms of areas and intensity estimations are consistent with previous knowledge. The method reveal the rotational and other mid-term periodicities in the extracted time series across solar cycle.\na fusion approach that allows to aggregate (17.1 nm, 19.5 nm) data stemming from the solar EIT instrument onboard the SoHO mission, and that is ﬂexible enough to allow the integration of other type of information. The method is based on both a spatially constrained possibilistic clustering algorithm and a context dependent fusion operator. It aggregates the complementary and redundant information coming from the input sources. The results obtained on a 9-year dataset are consistent with those found in the solar physics literature. Unlike previous algorithms used in solar physics, our method has the ability to add further heterogeneous sources and sensors (e.g. human knowledge, images in other bandpasses, ratio of images) to the process, in order to postpone the decision step (here the segmentation of structures of interest) until sufﬁcient information is available.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nB Mampaey, V Delouille, C Verbeeck, JF Hochedez, V Barra.

    "text": "Topographic Analysis of Electrode Contacts in Human Cortical Stimulation\n\nElectric chronic stimulation of the human motor cortex (ECSM) has been reported to alleviate chronic severe pain. However the mechanism of action of ECSM is still hypothetical. This is due mainly to the poor knowledge of, 1) the electric diffusion through the multiple structures beneath the epidural contacts (i.e. dura matter, cerebrospinal fluid space, arachnoid membrane, grey and white matter layers, pie mere and vascular tree), 2) the absence of consensus concerning the stimulation parameters (mono versus bipolar stimulation, cathodic or anodic current) and 3) the detailed cortical topography of the contacts. In this study we focused on the precise identification of the cortical areas covered by the electric contacts in a series of twelve patients operated on for ECSM. We proposed a new automatic tool for topographic analysis able to compute 2D maps from the 3D anatomic MRI with bijective transformation (point-to- point correspondance). Anatomical regions of interest (AROIs) were visually identified, manually outlined and extracted (Iplan, BrainLab, Germany) for further analysis : 1) for the anatomic structures, on pre operative T1-weigthed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the frontal (superior or F1, intermediate or F2 and inferior or F3), the pre central and the post central gyrus ; 2) for the electrode contacts (Resume, Medtronic, USA), on post operative computerized tomography (CT). After getting white and gray matter membership maps by automatic segmentation, we produced a cortical mask to build a triangular mesh. We defined a homeomorphism between the 3D mesh and a subset of R2 and could apply in consequence the circle packing algorithm. We built depth maps (distance to the skull), distance to- contact maps (distance to a given electrode contact) and anatomic structure maps.\n\n\n\nResults showed that it was easier to accurately define the location of the contact projection on the cortex allowing physicians to correlate the benefit with the topography. In particular, because of the unfolding, it was easier to integrate the cytoarchitectonics (i.e. the manually identified AROIs) knowledge in the analysis. Beyond the better understanding of ECSM and indirectly of the pathophysiologic process of chronic pain, this new tool might be used in the future for image guided electrode positioning.\n\nRelated publications\n\nJM Favreau, V Barra.

    "text": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a technique for brain stimulation. As another techniques like ElectroConvulsive Therapy (ECT) or the implantation of electrodes into motor cortex, TMS excites neurones. But contrary to those techniques, TMS is painless and noninvasive. Indeed, neurones are excited by electrical current induced by a rapidly changing magnetic field. This field is created by the discharge of thyristor (during about 300 μs) into a coil i.e a copper winding surrounded by a water-cooled system. The current circulating through the coil is about 10000 A in order to allow magnetic field to cross the skull of the patient.\nUsing TMS is sometimes still empirical. The clinician who wants to stimulate a specific cortex area given an expected result (phosphene, modification of vision, motor effect) will perform several stimulations, scanning over the patient’s scalp to find the most important response.\nWe thus proposed in this project to develop a transcranial magnetic stimulation simulator : according to position and orientation of the coil and to the parameters of the stimulation, the simulator will give a modelling of the stimulation effects. Result will be mapped on MRI image of the patient.\nThe TMS simulator is composed of three main tools :\n\nA numerical tool, to compute magnetic field generated by a given coil at any point of the empty-space. The aim is first to assess the magnetic field induced by the coil, then to provide a finite-element scheme boundaries conditions and finally to finite-element computation in free space.\nA design tool, able to take into account the specificity of each winding copper shape. For a given contour, the user has only to define a 3D-parametrical curve and the expression of its derivative\nAn interface tool, providing some results such as the maps of magnetic and potential vector field, mapped on a 3D brain of the patient, and some interactions ( position/orientation of the coil w.r.t. the patient…)\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nE Innocenti, S Luquet, D Hill, V Barra.

The methods we included in our study concerned local algorithms (LIMOS and Bergen), and segmentation algorithms provided by SPM5, FreeSurfer, and FSL. This eﬀort was related to a multidisciplinary project on cognitive aging where the group in Bergen has acquired dual volume T1-weighted 3D brain images from 110 elderly subjects (age : 46-79 years) where also genotyping (APOE, Chrna4, BDNF) and results from extensive neuropsychological phenotyping is obtained. The best performing methods from the brain segmentation and morphometric studies were then be applied to this large image collection and numerical measures incorporated into statistical analysis for better insight in the aging process.\nMore speciﬁcally, the present project addressed the following issues :\n\nMethods for performance evaluation\nOptimal use of dual MR acquisitions (separate volume classiﬁcation ? image registration ? value of single versus dual acquisition ?)\nInﬂuence of spatial inhomogeneities and noise in the MR signal, how to correct it ?

    "text": "Fusion of Image/Expert information\n\nExpert knowledge information relate to indications of position, of form…, and can be clarified as fuzzy proposals (modeling the reflexions of a specialist) and/or as a brain atlas . Fusion thus takes place on heterogeneous and rather complementary data which are not necessarily expressed within the same formal framework (numerical for the images and the atlas, linguistics for expert knowledge). The interest of fusion is here to push back the decision (the segmentation of structures for example) until having sufficient information. This remark, which prevails in general for fusion, is remarkably illustrated in this type of problem, where the information of gray level or coarse position is not enough with the segmentation, but where the aggregation of the whole set of knowledge allows to infer a reliable decision.\nThe use of this type of method relates mainly to the segmentation of cerebral structures starting from images, atlas and symbolic data modeling expert knowledge. This segmentation can take place for the whole brain with, for example, a research of the hemispheres and cerebellum or stick more particularly to the detection of fine anatomical structures implied in specific pathologies. The clinical implications go then from the targeting of structures for a help to the surgical act to the follow-up of morphometric measurements of a pathological entity.\nWe applied this method :\n\nto the segmentation of the subthalamic nucleus within the framework of the treatment of the idiopathic Parkinson’s disease by electrostimulation\nto the segmentation of striatum\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nV Barra, JJ Lemaire, F Durif, JY Boire.

We focused on brain imaging, although the principle may be extended to other organs provided image are spatially registered. The anatomical images mainly consisted of MR images that give information on structural composition of the organ (distribution of tissues, fine spatial resolution). They can be obtain using a wide range of parameters, so that the resulting images provide sufficient contrasts between the different structures to be located (tissue interfaces, tumors,…). The functional images were obtained by injecting a radioactive tracer that preferentially characterized a physiologic (e.g., glucose metabolism) or a biologic process (e.g., blood flow). Two major functional modalities are used in brain imaging : SPECT and PET. These images had a bad spatial resolution and are not informative on what they were not supposed to represent.\nIn the following, anatomical and functional images were supposed to be registered.

    "text": "Brain image segmentation\n\nThe ability of precisely quantifying cerebral tissue volumes in various diseases (Alzheimer, hydrocephaly…) must make it possible to largely improve the diagnosis, the treatment and the general understanding of pathologies. We proposed in 2000 a unsupervised fuzzy classification scheme for brain tissue segmentation. The boundary between brain in an MR image is smooth or fuzzy rather than sharp or crisp. Moreover, noise, partial volume effect and anatomical variations within pure tissue (White Matter,Gray Matter, Cerebrospinal Fluid) activities introduce uncertainty and fuzzyness in the image. We thus used a fuzzy clustering algorithm rather than a crisp one, and particularly the possibilistic clustering algorithm (PCA). PCA allows to interpret memberships as absolute degrees of belonging, whereas they are similar to degrees of sharing or relative memberships in the case of FCM. Because of the complex nature of (GM/WM) or (GM/CF) interfaces in MR images, a significant number of voxels contains a mixture of two or three tissues.\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nF Klauschen, A Goldman, V Barra, A Meyer-Lindenberg, A Lundervold.

In this work, we propose a real-time framework that hybrids models in the top-down scheme for 3D multi-person absolute pose estimation from a monocular camera. We compared three different strategies proposed to obtain the final poses. Two of them integrate human bounding boxes detector, 2D pose estimator, 3D root-relative pose reconstructor and root depth estimator. The other one uses a 3D absolute pose estimator directly after the estimation of 2D points. We evaluate our system called Root-GastNet on the root joint localization with two benchmark datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MuPoTS-3D. The experimental results show that all three strategies outperform the state-of-the-art on the MuPoTS-3D dataset. Moreover, it could be applied in real-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. El Kaid, K. Baina, J.

    "text": "Modular Ensemble tracking\n\nNumerous works identify object tracking as a critical issue in many applications such as surveillance and anomaly detection. Among all definitions, the simplest but clearest one defines tracking as the estimation from a video sequence of the trajectory of moving object in the image plane. The tracking by itself is composed of two steps : an object detection step, where potential candidates are identified in each frame of the sequence, and a tracking step, where a specific candidate is tracked all along the frames. Depending on the constraints imposed on these two steps, several methods and algorithms are available.\nWe imposed four constraints : we wanted the tracker to be (i) robust (ii) real-time (iii) able to track pedestrians and (iv) usable from mobile cameras acquisitions. Considering these four points, numerous tracking methods are available, that can be separated into four main categories. Background subtraction, silhouette tracking, points tracking and supervised learning methods. Due to constraints (iii), the -first two ones are inappropriate and we focused on the remaining two other categories.\nWe proposed to have a double point of view, by combining Point tracking and supervised learning methods into a modular version of the Ensemble Tracking Algorithm (MET). Classifiers were trained with Adaboost on homogeneous feature spaces, and the classification decisions were used by a particle filter specially designed for the application.\nThe MET algorithm is based on two ideas. The main drawback of the classical Ensemble Tracking algorithm relies on the definition of its strong classifier, since each weak classifier works on an heterogeneous feature space. We thus decided to split this feature space into several homogeneous subspaces (called modules) where a strong classifier lives and takes a decision on the position of the object to tracking is computed. Splitting the feature space strongly modifies the objective of the tracking process : a tracking algorithm now has to estimate a hidden state composed on the one hand of the position and the dimensions of the object, and on the other hand of the linear weights of the decisions, leading to the most discriminant observation. The second modification we proposed, resolving this second objective, was based on the construction of a specific particle filter jointly managing both the positions and dimensions of the object and the weights of the modules.\nTracking on a mobile camera\n\n\n\nScaling on a camera with mobile optical center\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nT Penne, C Tilmant, T Chateau, V Barra.

The cDNAs included about 8000 human different genes, and almost 80% of them were correctly identified. The data of interest we used here were composed of a 60× 1416 gene subset, including 1375 distinct genes (filtered using the highest variance criterion) with some repetitions. The rows to be analyzed were then the cancer cell lines, subject to the variation of the 1416 gene expressions. The high dimension parameter space prevented from a direct visual analysis and we chose to apply our method both to reduce the parameter space dimension and to exhibit common patterns of variations for cancer cell-lines For both applications, we computed the functional principal components, which shed light on the principal variations (temporal in the sporulation case, and tumoral in the second dataset).

One great challenge in microarray software assessment is thus the creation of simulated microarrays. We proposed a two-step process for the modeling of microarrays experiments. A geometrical model was first proposed, which simulated the microarray appearance and the possible spot geometries.

Due to the precision and resolution, the resulting virtual surface may not capture the full topological and/or geometrical details of the original surface, and are prone to artifacts that misrepresent the data.\nWa propose here to tackle the problem of mapping a surface acquired from a real object onto a piece of the plane, taking into account the topological and geometrical properties of the surface, as well as the specificity of low-resolution acquisitions. We introduce a cutting process used to manage the topological constraint of the one-to-one mapping, with some speedup improvements.

After some segmentation steps and a surface reconstruction, a mesh is obtained, modeling the region of interest on the cortical surface.

A tubular region, we will call a (topological) cylinder, can be defined as a surface homeomorphic to a cylinder, i.e. of genus zero with two boundaries. Tiling a surface with cylinders is a topological question, since the minimal number of cylindrical patches that will segment the surface is defined by its topology. It’s also a geometrical issue, since the connections between cylinders have to be driven by the shape of the surface. Moreover, some specific extrusions can be described by their own cylinder. We describe a formalism for segmenting a surface into cylinders using n-loops (an original generalization of the loops) as a cutting tool, to monitor the shape and length of the junctions. Using this formalism, the combinatorial configurations of the junctions between cylinders are precisely described, and the structure of the tilings can be exploited in the applicative fields.\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nJM Favreau, V Barra.

In this work, we describe an original approach to tile a surface with large quadrangles, satisfying combinatorial, geometrical and topological constraints. The large tiles resulting from our cutting process can be easily fitted by NURBS because of the properties of this decomposition. The topological control is managed through the critical points of a scalar function defined on the surface, and the cutting paths are not necesserily following the original mesh edges.
